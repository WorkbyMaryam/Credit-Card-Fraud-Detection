# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card usage. By employing various machine learning techniques, we aim to analyze transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud. This analysis helps financial institutions and credit card companies mitigate risks, prevent fraudulent activities, and protect their customers.

## Steps Involved

### Loading the Dataset

- Download and load the dataset containing credit card transaction data with labels indicating fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions.

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values by filling them with appropriate statistics.
- Encode categorical variables and standardize features to prepare the data for model training.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- Implement and evaluate different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing model.
- Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Use Grid Search to optimize the hyperparameters of the best model to improve its performance.

### Feature Importance Analysis

- Analyze the importance of various features in predicting fraud to gain insights into key factors influencing fraudulent transactions.

### Model Saving and Deployment

- Save the trained model using joblib for deployment in a production environment.
- Set up processes for ongoing monitoring and retraining of the model as needed.
